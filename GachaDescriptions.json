    "Simple Gacha": "In this simple gacha, the rates are normalized and simplified, with no pity system. You likely won't find a gacha like this in the market where it's simplified and true RNG.",
    "Star Gacha": "Did you know? There are often pity formulas implemented in actual gachas to allow players to have a high or guaranteed chance of obtaining something after a certain number of pulls.",
    "Boat Gacha": "For this gacha, an Ultra Rare is guaranteed every 200 pulls until 800 no matter what, serving as a static pity to get Ultra Rare from it up to four times."
